% In this section, we will introduce the \emph{Industrial Modelling Collaboration Language}(IMCL), which can describe the physical resources and systems in an unified model. This language achieves platform independence of different systems, and supports the decomposition and collaboration of the complex system.
% The \emph{IMCL} is an event-triggered imperative language, which including the composition of event triggered, message communication and data synchronism under the constraint of system resources.

\emph{IMCL} is an event-triggered language. The event trigger is a system running mechanism that the processing of some function waiting for the event triggers and then execute the corresponding operation of this event. Here, we will introduce the abstract syntactic of \emph{IMCL}.

\subsection{The Syntax of $IMCL$}

The abstract syntactic sets of \emph{IMCL} are defined as follows:
% 定义数值
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        A_{exp} ::= &\ val \mid X \mid a_{0} + a_{1} \mid a_{0} - a_{1} \mid a_{0} * a_{1} \mid a_{0} / a_{1} \\
        B_{exp} ::= &\ \top \mid \bot \mid a_{0} = a_{1} \mid a_{0} \neq a_{1} \mid a_{0} > a_{1} \mid a_{0} < a_{1} \\
        C_{exp} ::= &\ channel!m \mid channel?m \mid sync.n \\
        E_{exp} ::= &\ E_{0};E_{1} \mid E_{0} \triangleleft b \triangleright E_{1} \mid b * E \mid X := a \mid C_{exp} \\
                    &\mid a \gg Dev \mid a \ll Dev \\
        T_{exp} ::= &\ trigger \ b \diamond E \mid trigger \ channel?m \diamond E  \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item $A_{exp}$ is the arithmetic expression. Where $val$ is value, the $X$ a variable and $a_{0}, a_{1} \in A_{exp}$.
%  \item $B_{exp}$ is the boolean expression. Where $\top$ and $\bot$ are signifying the \emph{true} and \emph{false} respectively. For every \emph{b} $\in$ \emph{Bexp}, it is a bool expression.
%  \item $C_{exp}$ is the communication expression. The $channel!m$ signifies sending a value $m$ from a $channel$ . The $channel?m$ signifies receiving a value $m$ from a $channel$. The $sync.n$ means that get the synchronous data $n$.
%  \item $E_{exp}$ is the execution expression. For $E_{0},E_{1} \in Eexp$. $E_{0};E_{1}$ represents the sequential composition of $E_{0}$ and $E_{1}$. The syntax of condition choice $E_{0} \triangleleft b \triangleright E_{1}$ behaves like $E_{0}$ if $b$ is true, or $E_{1}$ otherwise. The $b * E$ indicates that the $E$ will iterates until $b$ is false. Assignment expression $X := a$ assigns the value of the expression a to the variable X. The $C$ is a $C_{exp}$ which indicates that it can be denoted as an $E_{exp}$. Specifically, for a value $a$, the $a \gg Dev$ denotes that system transmit the $a$ to the the physical device $Dev$ in a system, and $Dev \ll a$ indicates that getting the $a$ from $Dev$.
%  \item $T_{exp}$ is the event-trigger expression. The $trigger \ b \diamond E$ denotes an event-trigger happens when the $b$ is true. The $ trigger \ channel?m \diamond E_{exp}$ indicates that when receiving a $m$ from the $channel$, the event $E$ will begin to execute.
%\end{itemize}
$A_{exp}$ is the arithmetic expression where $val$ is value, $X$ is variable, $a_{0}, a_{1} \in A_{exp}$.
$B_{exp}$ is the boolean expression, where $\top$ and $\bot$ are signifying the \emph{true} and \emph{false}. For every \emph{b} $\in$ $B_{exp}$, it is a bool expression. Next, we mainly introduce some specially expression in \emph{IMCL}. $C_{exp}$ is the communication expression. The $channel!m$ signifies sending a value $m$ from a $channel$ . The $channel?m$ signifies receiving a value $m$ from a $channel$. The $sync.n$ means to get the synchronous data $n$.
$E_{exp}$ is the execution expression. Condition choice $E_{0} \triangleleft b \triangleright E_{1}$ is that if $b$ is true then $E_{0}$, else $E_{1}$. The $b * E$ indicates that the $E$ will iterates until $b$ is false. Specifically, $a \gg Dev$ denotes that system transmit value $a$ to physical device $Dev$, while $Dev \ll a$ is getting $a$ from $Dev$. $T_{exp}$ is the event-triggered expression. The $trigger \ b \diamond E$ denotes an event $E$ happens when the $b$ is true. The $ trigger \ channel?m \diamond E_{exp}$ indicates that when receiving a $m$ from the $channel$, the event $E$ will begin to execute.

%\subsection{Modelling the Industrial System Using IMCL}
\subsection{\emph{IMCL} Model for Industrial Control System}

The modelling process focuses on system functions and features as following two steps:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item \textbf{Modelling the physical resources} \\
%  Representations of physical resources are different based on diverse industrial environment, for instant, sensors, read-write devices and the other resources. Considering their effects on the whole system, we abstract describe all those resources as variables to unifying definition of resources.
%  \item \textbf{Modelling the system} \\
%  Observing its behavior, the nature of system is gathering functions, read-write operations, and other actions together. Similar to physical resources, we model them as execution expressions. Multiple execution expressions in one specific order can make up one trigger event marked as $T$.
%
%  An IMCL model consists of multiple concurrent trigger events, and every event is triggered only when its condition is satisfied. Then, the IMCL model can be defined:
%    \begin{displaymath}
%    Prog = \overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\bowtie}} T_{i}, n \in N^{+}
%    \end{displaymath}
%    Where the \emph{Prog} denotes one system model, \emph{$T_{i} \in T_{exp}$} demotes the event-triggered expression int system model. The $\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\bowtie}} T_{i}$ signifies those concurrent event-triggers are concurrent in one system. For instrant, a given $Prog = T_{1} \bowtie T_{2} \bowtie T_{3}$, which demotes that the model $Prog$ contains three trigger events: $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$. For different IMCL models, they can interact with each other through message communication and data synchronization.
%\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Modelling the physical resources. }
Representations of physical resources are different based on diverse industrial environment, for instance, sensors, read-write devices, and the other resources. Considering their effects on the whole system, we describe all those resources as variables to unifying definition of resources.

\textbf{Modelling the system. }
Observing its behavior, the nature of the system is gathering functions, read-write operations, and other actions together. Similar to physical resources, we model them as execution expressions. Multiple execution expressions in one specific order can make up one trigger event marked as $T$.

An \emph{IMCL} model consists of multiple concurrent trigger events, and every event is triggered only when its condition is satisfied. Let $\bowtie$ be the concurrent operation of two events s.t. $T_1\bowtie T_2$. Then, the \emph{IMCL} model \emph{Prog} can be defined:
\begin{displaymath}
Prog = \overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\bowtie}} T_{i}, n \in N^{+}
\end{displaymath}
% Taking $Prog = T_{1} \bowtie T_{2} \bowtie T_{3}$ for example, the model $Prog$ contains three trigger events: $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$.
% For different IMCL models, they can interact with each other through message communication and data synchronization.


\textbf{\emph{Example 1.}} \ There is an industrial control system, the data collector \emph{collects} information and saves it to the \emph{database}. When the temperature \emph{sensor} is detected above 200 degrees, the system turns on the \emph{fan} to cool down. The \emph{IMCL} model of this system is shown as follow:

  program : Example() [VAR: tmp, data]
  {
      TRIGGER(sensor > 200)   // trigger event: T1
      {
          tmp := cool;
          tmp >> Fan;
      }

      TRIGGER(TRUE)           // trigger event: T2
      {
          data << collector;
          data >> database;
      }
  }
\end{lstlisting}


We abstract the physical resources in system as variables. The $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two  trigger events that represent different functions. The system model can be described like $Prog = T_{1} \bowtie T_{2}$.

%\subsection{Program Analysis}

%\textbf{Program Analysis}In computer science, program analysis is the process of automatically analyzing the behavior of computer programs regarding a property such as correctness, robustness, safety and liveness. In general, program analysis focuses on two major areas: program optimization and program correctness. The first focuses on improving the program’s performance while reducing the resource usage while the latter focuses on ensuring that the program does what it is supposed to do.
%
%Program can be roughly divided into two categories：1) static analysis which is performed without exectuting the program; 2) dynamic analysis which is performed during runtime. But in practice, an analysis may be performed in a combination of both.
%
%Static analysis usually be conducted upon the program source code, intermediate code and object code. It used to be consisted of four effective core methods including Controal-Flow Analysis, Data-Flow Analysis, Abstraction Interpretation and Type and Effect Systems. Nowadays, the method of model checking is introduced for program verfication.
%
%Dynamic anlysis is based on runtime knowledge of the program, which can be used to increasing the precision of the analysis while also providing runtime protection. Howerver, dynamic analysis is imcomplete and invasive, beacuse it can only analyze a few single executions of the program and might degrade the program's performance due to runtime checks.


%\textbf{Program Slicing} For a given subset of a program’s behavior, program slicing consists of reducing the program to the minimum form that still produces the selected behavior. The reduced program is called a “slice” and is a faithful representation of the original program within the domain of the specified behavior subset. Generally, finding a slice is an unsolvable problem, but by specifying the target behavior subset by the values of a set of variables, it is possible to obtain approximate slices using a data-flow algorithm. These slices are usually used by developers during debugging to locate the source of errors.
%
%Based on the original definition of Weiser, informally, a static program slice S consists of all statements in program P that may affect the value of variable v at some point p. The slice is defined for a slicing criterion C=(x,V), where x is a statement in program P and V is a subset of variables in P. A static slice includes all the statements that affect variable v for a set of all possible inputs at the point of interest (i.e., at the statement x)[clarification needed]. Static slices are computed by finding consecutive sets of indirectly relevant statements, according to data and control dependencies.
