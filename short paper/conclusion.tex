\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, \emph{IMCL} is proposed to model the industrial control systems taking unifying physical resources and systems into consideration.
% With the given physical resources constraints, we decompose the complex system to multiple CUs through replacing a system model with various sub-models based on the SDG-based analysis.
% For the given resource constraints, we coordinate the system communication and collaborative functions to find the most optimizing solution about the system model decomposition and collaboration research through an evaluation we present.
Specially, with the given physical resource constraints, we introduce the approach of decomposition and collaboration based on the SDG analysis.
After describing one complex system with the \emph{IMCL}, we can break the complex system into multiple smaller and simpler sub-systems. 
Importantly, these sub-systems can hold the same function with the original system by collaborating based on a specific communication mechanism.
% In the future, we will study the code generation method from IMCL to some particular industry programming language and thereby enhance the applicability of our research.
