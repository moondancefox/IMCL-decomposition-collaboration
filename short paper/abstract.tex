With the development of ``Industry 4.0'', the scale and complexity of industrial control system grow rapidly.
Hence, the analysis and verification of such systems face really big challenges.
Industry requires a reliable approach for decomposing the existing complex system model to multiple fine-grained and interactive models.
In this paper, we propose a general event-triggered language named \emph{IMCL} for modeling industrial control systems.
\emph{IMCL} can describe the physical resources and system in one unified model.
Specially, for the given resource constraints, we research the reliable and efficient approach of decomposition and collaboration based on \emph{IMCL} models to meet the industrial requirements. In particular, we have implemented the approach in our tool and get the encouraging results.

% As the function and intelligence of industrial systems become more sophisticated, traditional single core processor will suffer more computing tasks. This paper aims to propose a method to decompose and collaborate one system under the physical resources constraint. Traditional single core processor is replaced by a cluster of heterogeneous and isomorphism computing units available in the system, enabling the replacement of a single model with multiple sub-models. In this paper, we propose a general event-triggered language named \emph{IMCL}, which can abstract the system resources and functions to achieve platform independence, and keeps the physical resources and systems in a unified model. On the premise of the given resource constraints, we propose the decomposition and collaboration algorithms based on the coordination of the system communication and collaboration functions, and ultimately to achieve the optimal solution that a collaborative multi-systems model can replace the traditional single-system model.

%As the function and intelligence of industrial systems become sophisticated, the traditional industrial environment is becoming more complex and will suffer more computing tasks. It is a challenge to use multiple processors to collaborate with each other to partake the complex system environment efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method that the traditional processor can be replaced by a cluster of heterogeneous computing units available in one industrial system. To achieve platform independence of different systems, we present a general event-triggered language named \emph{IMCL}, which can describe the physical resources and systems in an unified model. On the premise of the given resource constraints, we propose the decomposition and collaboration algorithms based on the coordination of the system communication and collaboration functions, and ultimately to achieve the optimal solution that a collaborative multi-systems model can replace the traditional system model.
