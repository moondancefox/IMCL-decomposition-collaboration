\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, \emph{IMCL} is proposed to model the industrial control systems taking unifying physical resources and systems into consideration.
% With the given physical resources constraints, we decompose the complex system to multiple CUs through replacing a system model with various sub-models based on the SDG-based analysis.
% For the given resource constraints, we coordinate the system communication and collaborative functions to find the most optimizing solution about the system model decomposition and collaboration research through an evaluation we present.
Specially, with the given physical resource constraints, we implement the decomposition and collaboration algorithms based on the SDG analysis, which can decompose the complicated system model to multiple collaboration sub-models of CUs efficiently and reliably.
Moreover, we compare the different solutions of collaboration to get the most optimal collaboration model in algorithms.
In the future,  we will optimize the algorithm and focus on the research about the time attribute in the industrial control system for IMCL. Also, we will study the code generation method from IMCL to some particular industry programming language and thereby enhance the applicability of our research.
